Write a function named addTotal that will take a shopping cart array and a state abbreviation either 'NY', 'NJ', or 'CT'. The cart will return the total with included taxes for that state. For Extra credit addTotal must use reduce. If having trouble with reduce, may use another strategy. Checkout the toFixed method will round to two places but returns a string so will need to turn back to a number. See Number method linked below.
